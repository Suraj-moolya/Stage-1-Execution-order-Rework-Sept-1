Scenario Outline: Creating Multiple instances with specific template in Application Explorer
  When I search text template browser AE Templates browser in application explorer as '<TemplatesBrowser1>'
  And I drag Template from Template browser and drop to Application browser '<Count>' times with template as '<TemplatesBrowser2>'
  Then Verify the template is present in Application browser as '<TemplatesBrowser1>'

  @Create_Instances_5000
  Examples:
    | SlNo | TemplatesBrowser1 | TemplatesBrowser2  | Count |
    | 1    | MotorGP           | MotorGP_1$$1.0.123 | 5000  |
